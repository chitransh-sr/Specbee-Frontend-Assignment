# Specbee Frontend Assignment

As a user, I was to view a Speaker component that will list out the Speakers for a conference in a slider. When a Speaker card is clicked more information will be displayed about the speaker in a popup above the fold.


## ABOUT PROJECT

## Technlogies Used

*Semantic HTML following BEM naming methodology, CSS, Vanilla  JS

*Bootstrap CSS Framework  for Carousel

*Media Queries for Responsiveness for different Screen Sizes.
